SL.glm: Wrapper for generalized linear models via glm().

SL.earth: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines.

SL.ranger: Ranger is a fast implementation of Random Forest (Breiman 2001) or recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data.

SL.xgboost: XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems.

SL.mean: Intercept only regression

SL.gam: Generalized Additive Models
